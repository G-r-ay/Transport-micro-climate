# Transport-micro-climate
Transport Conditions Prediction: ML models analyzing telematics, weather, and sensor data to predict dangerous temperature and humidity conditions during high-value goods transportation.

## Description
This repository contains the following files:

- `Model_weights`: This file contains the trained weights of the model.
- `tools`: This folder contains the scaler and encoder that are used in the project.
- `Temprtature_Humidity.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code for analyzing temperature and humidity data.
- `predict.py`: This Python script provides the functionality to make predictions using the trained model.
- `report.pdf`: This PDF document contains a detailed report on the project, including analysis, results, and conclusions.

## Usage
Here is a brief overview of the files and their purposes:

- `Model_weights` should be used for loading the trained weights into the model for inference or further training.
- The `tools` folder contains various tools and utilities that can be used to enhance the functionality of the project.
- `Temprtature_Humidity.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook file that can be opened and executed in a Jupyter Notebook environment. It contains code and explanations for analyzing temperature and humidity data.
- `predict.py` is a Python script that provides a command-line interface to make predictions using the trained model.
- `report.pdf` is a comprehensive report that presents the analysis, results, and conclusions of the project.
